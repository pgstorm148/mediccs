                Tania S. Malik, J.D. is a Co-Founder and CEO of Virtual Medical
                Services, PC. She has spent the past 23 years dedicated to
                creating digital health companies to solve unmet needs in
                healthcare.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Tania’s digital health experience includes the development and
                growth of three telehealth companies that combined to provide an
                online consultation with a national network of board-certified
                physicians where the treatment plan included a prescription.
                Additionally, Tania started a telehealth company that focused on
                naturopathic and integration medicine consultations which she
                implemented with a national payor.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                However, Tania’s true passions of honoring military veterans and
                using technology to solve healthcare problems came together when
                she was inspired to start COPE Today, a tele-mental health
                solution. COPE Today was started in response to the Iraq and
                Afghanistan Wars when she felt our country was not prepared for
                the severity of mental health conditions the soldiers were
                experiencing when they returned home. COPE Today’s first
                implementation was with the North Carolina National Guard where
                she began to deepen her understanding, gratitude. and respect
                for those that serve. She sold COPE Today to Mindcare Solutions
                Group, Inc., which continues to provide mental health treatment
                to all populations in need.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In conjunction with COPE Today, she started COPE Foundation
                (a/k/a Military Veteran Resource Coalition) which provided
                service members and veterans with emergency funding to help with
                needs such as paying electric bills to keep power or rent to
                prevent homelessness.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Today, she is President and one of the founding Board of
                Directors for In-Kind Friends, a non- profit that helps other
                non-profits amplify their community impact. She is a leader in
                the American Telemedicine Association, being the immediate Past
                Chair of the Telemental Health Special Interest Group. In 2020,
                she was awarded the ATA Woman of the Year and in 2021 she was
                elected to the ATA College of Fellows.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                She earned a bachelor’s degrees from the University of North
                Carolina in Chapel Hill and a Juris Doctorate from Georgia State
                University. She is licensed to practice law in both North
                Carolina and Georgia. She serves on two Strategic Advisor
                Boards-Innovatel Telepsychiatry, just acquired by Quartet, and
                Omnysense, a remote patient monitoring company.

                Tania has a passion for helping others and considers it an honor
                to support the veteran community and is grateful for their
                service.
